</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.)</li>
    <li>Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries)</li>
    <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>
    <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>
    <li>Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</li>
